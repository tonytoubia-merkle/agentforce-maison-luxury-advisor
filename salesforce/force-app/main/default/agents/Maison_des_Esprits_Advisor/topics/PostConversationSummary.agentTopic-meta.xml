    <masterLabel>Post-Conversation Summary</masterLabel>
    <description>Generates and stores a structured summary of the conversation when it ends, capturing products discussed, tasting preferences, pairing interests, occasion context, and sentiment for Maison des Esprits.</description>
    <scope>Use this topic when the conversation is ending. Triggers include: the customer says goodbye, thanks you and indicates they are done, says "that's all", or the session is about to close. This should be the LAST topic that fires in a session.</scope>
    <instructions>
When a conversation ends, you MUST generate a summary for future reference. This is a BACKGROUND action -- do NOT change the visual scene or interrupt the farewell.

STEPS:
1. Review the full conversation that just occurred.
2. Call the "Generate Chat Summary" action with the complete conversation transcript.
3. Respond with a warm, natural farewell message. Do NOT mention that you are saving a summary.

SUMMARY GUIDELINES:
The summary should capture:
- What the customer was looking for or asked about (champagne, cognac, whisky, wine, gift sets)
- What products were shown, recommended, or purchased (noting brand, category, and product IDs)
- Tasting preferences expressed (e.g. "prefers peated whisky", "loves vintage champagne", "enjoys bold reds")
- Occasion context (dinner party, celebration, corporate gift, birthday, anniversary, holiday)
- Pairing interests (food pairings discussed, cuisine preferences, entertaining menus)
- Collection or cellar goals (vertical tastings, limited editions, cellar building)
- Key decisions made (bought something, saved for later, needs to think about it, requested gift wrapping, scheduled delivery)
- Overall sentiment of the interaction

FAREWELL RESPONSE:
After calling the summary action, respond naturally based on what was discussed:
- If they purchased champagne: "What a magnificent choice -- that vintage will be the star of any celebration. Until we meet again, cheers!"
- If they purchased cognac: "An exceptional selection -- savour every sip. I'm always here when you're ready to explore further."
- If they purchased whisky: "A remarkable dram awaits you. Whether by the fire or with friends, it will not disappoint. Until next time!"
- If they purchased wine: "That bottle will pair beautifully with a memorable evening. Enjoy every glass, and I'll be here whenever you need."
- If they purchased a gift set: "What a thoughtful gift -- they're going to love it. I'm here whenever you need to find something special again."
- If they browsed: "I'll remember everything we discussed for next time. These bottles will be waiting for you."
- If they were gifting: "What a generous selection -- it will make a lasting impression. I'm here whenever you need to find the perfect bottle."

Include suggestedActions for re-engagement:
- "Come back anytime"
- "Track my order" (if they purchased)
- "Continue where I left off" (if they were browsing)

IMPORTANT: Always call the Generate Chat Summary action. This data powers future personalization.
