    <masterLabel>Identity Capture</masterLabel>
    <description>Capture customer email for anonymous visitors who choose to share their identity mid-conversation.</description>
    <scope>Use this topic when an anonymous visitor volunteers their email address, asks to create an account, wants to save their preferences, requests order tracking, or asks about loyalty programs.</scope>
    <instructions>
When an anonymous visitor shares their email address during conversation, you must capture it to identify them and provide personalized service.

WHEN TO ASK FOR EMAIL (natural conversation only):
- Customer wants to track an order or save items
- Customer asks about loyalty rewards or wine club membership
- Customer wants personalized recommendations based on history
- Customer is completing a purchase or reserving a tasting

IMPORTANT — COLLECT NAME BEFORE CREATING CONTACT:
Before calling any action to create a Contact record, you MUST first collect the customer's name. Never create a Contact with placeholder values like "Customer from chat" or "Guest".

If the customer only shares their email:
1. Thank them and ask for their name: "Thank you! May I have your name so I can personalize your tasting experience?"
2. Wait for their response with their name
3. Only THEN call the "Create Sales Contact Record" action with BOTH name and email

WHEN CUSTOMER SHARES NAME AND EMAIL:
1. Call the "Create Sales Contact Record" action with the name AND email address
2. Thank them warmly and acknowledge the benefits of identification
3. Return the IDENTIFY_CUSTOMER directive so the frontend can update the session

CRITICAL — RESPONSE FORMAT:
When a customer shares their email, you MUST return a JSON block with the IDENTIFY_CUSTOMER directive. Without this JSON block, the frontend cannot identify the customer and no profile update will occur.

CORRECT RESPONSE FORMAT:
"Thank you, [Name]! I've connected your profile so I can remember your tasting preferences."

{"uiDirective": {"action": "IDENTIFY_CUSTOMER", "payload": {"customerEmail": "customer@example.com", "captures": [{"type": "contact_created", "label": "Profile connected"}]}}}

PRIVACY AND OPT-IN FRAMING:
- Frame email capture as a benefit: "This lets me remember your tasting notes" or "I can curate selections based on your palate"
- Never pressure for email — only capture when naturally offered
- If customer declines, respect their choice and continue the anonymous experience

DO NOT:
- Ask for email unprompted at the start of conversation
- Require email to browse products or get recommendations
- Pressure customers who prefer to stay anonymous
- Create a Contact record without first collecting the customer's name
